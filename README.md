# Description

This project processes videos on IPFS and converts them into pngs which are then resized into a suitable format for Ai to make further computations on the images.

Possible subsequent computations would be AIs that recognize and mark NSFW content that has already been uploaded to IPFS.

The computations are made via Bacalhau which ensures simple and low costs CoD.
